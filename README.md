# webpack-tutorial
This is a test project to try the libraries:
- webpack (https://webpack.js.org/)
- babel: (https://babeljs.io/)
- bluebird (http://bluebirdjs.com)

In /src/js/app is the code using these libraries, call api rest to get data and try new features of ECMAScript 2015(ES6) inside from a generator, see code for more details.

Also I used css-loader and style-loader as modules to WEBPACK, and babel-polyfill, babel-loader, babel-preset-env to BABEL.

It was tested in browsers:

- Chrome 61.0.3163.91
- IE 11.0.9
- Firefox 54.0.1
